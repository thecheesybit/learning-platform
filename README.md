# **Learning and Online Teaching Platform**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a React-based online learning and teaching platform designed to support up to 200 students simultaneously. It offers features for teachers to manage and deliver courses, as well as for students to enroll, attend live classes, and access recorded sessions. The platform uses Firebase for authentication and data management, Jitsi Meet for live classes, and Firebase Storage for storing recorded classes.

## **Features**

### **1. User Authentication**
- **Sign-In with OTP:** Secure login using Firebase Authentication with OTP.
- **Role-Based Access:** Different dashboards and permissions for teachers and students.

### **2. Course Management**
- **Course Page:** Detailed information about each course, including syllabus and enrollment options.
- **Enrollment:** Students can enroll in courses through a one-time payment. The enrollment comes with a validity period that expires one year after the last live class of the course.

### **3. Live Classes**
- **Integration with Jitsi Meet:** Teachers can host live classes with video and screen sharing.
- **Scheduling:** Teachers can schedule classes, and links are automatically made visible to enrolled students in their course section.

### **4. Recorded Classes**
- **Video Storage:** Class recordings are stored securely in Firebase Storage.
- **Access Control:** Only enrolled students can access the recorded sessions.
- **Udemy-Like View:** Recorded classes are presented in a user-friendly interface.

### **5. Content Protection**
- **Screen Recording Prevention:** Implement measures to detect and block screen recording attempts.
- **Watermarking:** Flash the student’s name and number on the video player to prevent unauthorized sharing.

### **6. Dashboards**
- **Teacher Dashboard:** Manage courses, schedule classes, and view student enrollments.
- **Student Dashboard:** Access enrolled courses, join live classes, and view recorded sessions.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js:** For building the user interfaces and components.

### **Backend**
- **Firebase Authentication:** For secure login and OTP-based sign-in.
- **Firebase Firestore:** For storing user data, course details, and enrollment information.
- **Firebase Functions:** For handling server-side logic such as class scheduling and enrollment management.

### **Storage**
- **Firebase Storage:** For storing and managing class recordings.

### **Live Classes**
- **Jitsi Meet:** For hosting live video classes with options for screen sharing and recording.

## **Project Structure**
